# Payload
Code for an High Altitude Balloon Payload. 

This is the software for CAC's High Altitude Balloon payload. (At least the Arduino part.) 

## What we used:

For this part of the payload we used an [Arduino R3](https://store-usa.arduino.cc/products/arduino-uno-rev3?selectedStore=us) as the microcontroller. 

The sensors the Arduino used are:
* [BMP-388](https://www.adafruit.com/product/3966)
* [SHT31-D](https://www.adafruit.com/product/2857)
